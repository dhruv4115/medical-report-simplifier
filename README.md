# AI-Powered Medical Report Simplifier

This is a backend service that takes medical reports (either as raw text or scanned images) and uses a chain of AI prompts to produce patient-friendly explanations. It extracts, normalizes, and validates test results before generating a simple summary, ensuring no medical advice or hallucinated data is provided.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The application follows a standard Node.js service architecture:

* **Express API Layer**: A single `POST /api/process-report` endpoint handles all incoming requests, supporting both JSON (`text`) and multipart/form-data (`image`) inputs.
* **Controller**: Manages the request flow and orchestrates the services.
* **Service Layer**:
    * `ocr.service.js`: Uses Tesseract.js to perform Optical Character Recognition on image inputs.
    * `ai.service.js`: Interacts with the Google Gemini API. It contains separate, purpose-built prompts for **normalizing** data and **summarizing** results.
    * `validation.service.js`: Acts as a crucial **guardrail**, ensuring the AI does not "hallucinate" tests that were not present in the original input text.
* **MongoDB Data Layer**: Mongoose is used to model and save the final processed reports (both successful and unprocessed) for auditing and record-keeping.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dual Input**: Accepts both raw text and image uploads.
* **OCR**: Automatically extracts text from medical report images.
* **AI Normalization**: Converts unstructured text into a clean, consistent JSON format.
* **AI Summarization**: Explains abnormal results in simple, non-diagnostic terms.
* **Hallucination Guardrail**: Validates AI output against the source text to ensure data integrity.
* **Database Persistence**: Logs every request and its outcome in MongoDB.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* npm
* A MongoDB database instance (local or via Atlas)
* A Google Gemini API Key

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dhruv4115/medical-report-simplifier.git](https://github.com/dhruv4115/medical-report-simplifier.git)
    cd medical-report-simplifier
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables.
    ```
    # Your MongoDB connection string
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...

    # Your Google Gemini API Key
    GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...

    # The port to run the server on
    PORT=3000
    ```

4.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Usage

The API has a single endpoint for processing reports.

### Endpoint

`POST /api/process-report`

### 1. Submit Raw Text

Send a JSON payload with a `text` key.

**cURL Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "text": "Hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL (Low), WBC 11,200 /uL (High)"
}' \
http://localhost:3000/api/process-report
```

### 2. Submit an Image

Send a `multipart/form-data` request with an `image` key.

**cURL Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST -F "image=@/path/to/your/report.png" http://localhost:3000/api/process-report
```

### Success Response (`200 OK`)

```json
{
    "tests": [
        {
            "name": "Hemoglobin",
            "value": 10.2,
            "unit": "g/dL",
            "status": "Low"
        },
        {
            "name": "WBC",
            "value": 11200,
            "unit": "/uL",
            "status": "High"
        }
    ],
    "summary": "The report shows a low hemoglobin level and a high white blood cell count.",
    "explanations": [
        "Low hemoglobin may be related to conditions like anemia.",
        "High white blood cell counts can sometimes occur with infections."
    ],
    "status": "ok"
}
```

### Error Response - Hallucination Detected (`400 Bad Request`)

```json
{
    "status": "unprocessed",
    "reason": "hallucinated tests not present in input"
}
```
